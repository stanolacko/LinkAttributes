A MediaWiki extension ([http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:LinkAttributes Extension:LinkAttributes]) which extends the link syntax to allow custom attributes, such as rel="author" or item*.

;Release:  [https://github.com/stanolacko/LinkAttributes/tags v0.6] beta
;Dependencies: MediaWiki 1.39+

==Installation==
Upload to your extensions folder, and add the following settings to LocalSettings.php:
wfLoadExtension( 'LinkAttributes' );

==Usage==
Extra attributes are added at the end of a link, separated with a pipe (|) or a broken pipe (¦), like this:

    [[User:James|my page|rel=author]]

    [http://twitter.com/leo_wallentin my Twitter account|rel=me]

Allowed properties are: rel, rev, charset, type, hreflang and itemprop.

In some places (such as inside templates with tables) the pipe can be hard to use, as it has special meanings to MediaWiki. Therefore a broken pipe (¦) will also work with this extension: <pre>[[Oranges|Oranges¦itemprop=fruit]]</pre>.
Note that the following will NOT work: <pre>[[User:James|rel=author]]</pre>, as this extension has no way of knowing if rel=author is supposed to be an attribute or the actual text to be linked. The link would have to be written like this: <pre>[[User:James|James|rel=author]]</pre>. Also note that after installing this extension, pipes will not work in link texts.
